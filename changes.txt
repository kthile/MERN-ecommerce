1. Form field requires you to mouse in. Autofill will break
2. Server register post method needs to include something like .com, fix the regex
3. Register only shows static message on server errors. Maybe a way to print server errors?
4. Articles is not a good url. Change in server config and product_actions
5. Appropriate form errors based on SERVER. i.e. admin addproduct will show nothing if there is a duplicate name(key)
6. Card.js - if user adds to cart unauthenticated tell them they need to login and redirect
